# Contributing Guide

Thanks for wanting to help with this project.

To keep the code clean, functional and good quality, we have some guidelines that make contributing easier. Please read this before you send any Pull Request.

---

## 1. Project philosophy

We want contributions that:

- Make the software work better or more stable
- Make the code clearer and easier to maintain
- Solve real problems that are documented
- Fit with how the project is built now

We care about good technical work and how well you explain and document what you did.

---

## 2. Before you contribute

Check that:

- You wrote the code yourself or you have permission to share it
- You are not using code with incompatible licenses or code that breaks third party rights
- You know your contribution will use the same license as this project

---

## 3. Contributions we like

We appreciate contributions that:

- Fix bugs we can verify
- Make things faster without making code harder to read
- Improve documentation that already exists
- Make current features stronger and more reliable
- Suggest improvements that match what this project is trying to do

---

## 4. What we cannot accept

We will not merge changes that:

- Make performance worse or cause bugs
- Add dependencies we do not need or too many of them
- Change the architecture without good reasons
- Completely change what the software is supposed to do
- Have code from unclear sources or incompatible licenses
- Make things more complex without real benefits

---

## 5. How to submit a Pull Request

### Describing your change

Your PR needs to explain:

- What you changed and why you did it
- What problem it fixes or what it improves
- How someone can test it or check that it works

### Documentation

If your change affects how people use the project, you should update:

- Code comments where they are needed
- The README and other files that matter
- Examples of how to use it if that applies

### Consistency with the project

- Follow the code style that is already there
- Pick names for functions, variables and files that make sense and match what we use
- Do not repeat code or write redundant parts

### Technical quality

Your code needs to:

- Run with no errors
- Not break things that already work
- Keep performance the same or make it better
- Be easy to understand and maintain

## 6. Review process

After you submit your Pull Request:

- We will look at it manually
- We might ask you to change or improve some things before we approve it
- If it does not follow these guidelines, we might reject it and explain why

Let us keep things respectful and professional while we work together.

## 7. About the license

When you contribute, you agree your work will use the same license as the project. You need to make sure your contribution does not go against those terms.

We really appreciate the time and effort from people who want to make this project better. We will welcome your contribution if it meets our standards for quality and fits what we are building.
